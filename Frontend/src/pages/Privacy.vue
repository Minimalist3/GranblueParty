      <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including: </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">

      </ul>

    <h2 id="legalbases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

      <i><b>In Short:</b>  We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests. </i>

      <u> If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you. </u>

      <p> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information: </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li><b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more.</li>
        <li><b>Performance of a Contract.</b> We may process your personal information when we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.</li>
        <li><b>Legitimate Interests.</b> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to develop and display personalized and relevant advertising content for our users</li>
        <li><b> Legal Obligations.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. </li>
        <li><b>Vital Interests.</b> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</li>        
      </ul>

      <u> If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you. </u>

      <p> We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Click <a href="#withdrawconsent">here</a> to learn more. </p>

      <p> In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example: </p>

      <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
        <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
        <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
        <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
        <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
        <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
        <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
        <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
        <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
        <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
        <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
      </ul>

      <p> The Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions. </p>

    <h2 id="cookies">6. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>

      <p> When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. </p>

      <i><b>In Short:</b>  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</i>

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </p>

If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities. </p>

        <u> Right to be informed — Request to know </u>

        <p> Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know: </p>

        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
          <li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
          <li>the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</li>
          <li>whether we sell your personal information to third parties;</li>
          <li>the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;</li>
          <li>the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and</li>
          <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request. </p>

        <u> Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights </u>

        <p> We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights. </p>

        <u> Verification process </u>

        <p> Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate. </p>

        <p> We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you. </p>

        <u> Other privacy rights </u>
      
        <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
          <li>You may object to the processing of your personal information.</li>
          <li>You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the information.</li>
          <li>You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
          <li>You may request to opt out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.</li>
